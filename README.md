How to run the solution:
A Function App has already been created using VS code
The NodeJS script (index.js) has also been created and pushed to the repo
Create a Build Pipeline in Azure by creating a branch from the repo https://github.com/teewhyr/timestamp.git
Create a release pipeline into the Azure Function App
Once that is complete, test by copying and pasting your FunctionURL on your browser. You should see the current time, each time.
